{"name":"Social-notifier","body":"## About\r\n\r\nThis application was written and tested for ruby1.9.2 and is designed to\r\nwork in conjunction with the libnotify notification daemon to display a\r\nnotification on the desktop whenever a feed finds a new message from any\r\nof the following services:\r\n\r\n * Twitter          (Home feed, list, or search)\r\n * Gmail            (Inbox or any other label)\r\n * Google Voice     (SMS, Missed Calls, or Voicemails)\r\n * RSS / Atom Feeds\r\n * Github           (Commit messages and affected files)\r\n * SVN              (Commit messages and affected files)\r\n\r\nSince it is presently using libnotify, it is designed to work in Linux,\r\nAlthough I have heard of windows ports for libnotify, and additional\r\nnotifier classes could also be written for windows or mac notification\r\nlibraries\r\n\r\nOne running instance of the daemon can contain multiple and mixed feeds\r\nfrom which to retrieve updates.  Each type of request (i.e. Gmail, Gvoice,\r\nTwitter, etc.) is added to its own stack, and that stack will be scanned\r\nindependently.  One request from the request group will be sent every\r\n15 seconds. (This means that different types of requests will be scanned\r\nconcurrently)\r\n\r\nFuture goals are to allow for Facebook feeds as well.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo use this application in its present state, you must have the following\r\ngems installed: (use commands below).\r\n\r\n    sudo gem install libnotifier     # For using libnotify\r\n    sudo gem install nokogiri        # For using Google Voice, SVN, GitHub\r\n    sudo gem install simple-rss      # For using Gmail, RSS/Atom\r\n    sudo gem install twitter         # For using Twitter\r\n    sudo apt-get install subversion  # For using SVN (requires the command line client)\r\n\r\n*** Following facebook feeds isn't working right now, as the offline_access\r\n*** token is being deprecated.\r\n\r\n    sudo gem install fb_graph\r\n\r\n**config-dist.rb must be filled out and renamed as config.rb for the**\r\n**application to run, and you must fill out your twitter settings in**\r\n**that file (follow the instructions in that file) to access the**\r\n**Twitter API**\r\n\r\n## Instructions \r\n\r\n\r\n### Starting the daemon:\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb start\r\n\r\n### Adding requests to the stack:\r\n\r\nTwitter:\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb add twitter home\r\n    ruby application.rb add twitter list [list-owner] [list]\r\n    ruby application.rb add twitter search keyword\r\n    ruby application.rb add twitter search \"key words\"\r\n\r\nGmail (view unread within any label):\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb add gmail [label or 'inbox'] [username] [password]\r\n    ruby application.rb add gmail inbox [username/email] [password]\r\n    ruby application.rb add gmail work  [username/email] [password]\r\n\r\nGoogle Voice: (unread texts, voicemails, or missed calls)\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb add gvoice sms    [username/email] [password]\r\n    ruby application.rb add gvoice vm     [username/email] [password]\r\n    ruby application.rb add gvoice missed [username/email] [password]\r\n\r\nRSS / ATOM\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb add rss http://path.com/url/to/rss/feed\r\n    ruby application.rb add rss http://path.com/url/to/rss/feed [username] [password]  # (optional un/pass)\r\n\r\nSubversion\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb add subversion http[s]://path.com/url/to/repo [username] [password]\r\n    ruby application.rb add subversion http[s]://path.com/url/to/repo\r\n\r\nGitHub\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb add github [github commits atom URL]\r\n    ruby application.rb add github https://github.com/JaSpr/social-notifier/commits/master.atom\r\n\r\nThese commands all return a numbered list of requests in your stack,\r\nbut you can directly query the stack without adding any new requests...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Listing requests in the stack:\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb list\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deleting requests from the stack:\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb delete [entry type:entry index]\r\n    ruby application.rb delete gmail:1\r\n\r\nAfter deletion, the entry number will not be reassigned, so running\r\nthe command twice won't delete another entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stopping the daemon:\r\n\r\n    ruby application.rb stop\r\n\r\n## Debugging\r\n\r\nA storage directory is created in your home directory in a directory named\r\n.social-notifier .  This directory contains a subdirectory 'log' which\r\ncontains the application log ( everything purposefully logged to the output )\r\nand the debug log, which is lists ruby debug messages.\r\n\r\n    tail -f ~/.social-notifier/log/*\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a twitter-images folder is created to store Twitter user images\r\nso that they can be displayed with the tweet notification.","tagline":"Ruby application that makes use of linux's libnotify to pop-up notifications when new tweets are retrieved from the Twitter API.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
